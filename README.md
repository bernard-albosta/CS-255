# CS-255
--Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?--
DriverPass wanted a system that allowed students to sign up for courses, schedule in-person driving lessons, complete practice tests, and track their progress. The system needed role-based access for admistrators, instructors and students..that also had integration to DMV updates.

--What did you do particularly well?--
I did particularly well in identifying the different users of the system and mapping out how their needs translated to specific system functions. The use case diagram clearly showed the connections between users, appointments, and learning modules. This helped create a system design that was easy to understand and scalable.

--If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?--
If I could redo 1 document to revise, I would choose the sequence diagram. I could have made it simpler to read with clearer labeling and layout.

--How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?--
I interpreted the user's needs by look at what tasks students, instructors, and administrators needed to be able to complete. I then made sure the system met those needs in a simple and efficient way. It's important to consider the users needs because it makes sure the final system is actually usable and able to address those specific needs.

--How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?--
I try to approach software design by breaking down the whole systems functionality into smaller system functions. Then I create a visual model like a diagram to help plan the actul system structure. In the future I would add the creation of a user stories document to help in the creation of the system diagrams.
